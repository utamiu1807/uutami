# Trump_Trade_EDA_Template
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of trade flows before/after the Trump administration  
Purpose: 
This project analyzes U.S. import patterns from 2023–2025 to evaluate how reciprocal tariffs and special trade deals under the Trump administration influenced CIF import values across countries and industries. The analysis includes classification of goods by HTS codes, industry aggregation, and visualization of tariff-related trends.

Limitations:
1. There are 10 category for goods imported, which HTS 2, HTS 4, HTS 6, HTS 8, and HTS 10. For this analysis, I only using data for HTS 2 and HTS 4.
2. For 2025, There is only available data until August 2025.

What is HTS?
HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) is the standardized system the U.S. uses to classify imported goods. Each product is assigned a unique HTS code.
These codes determine tariff rates, trade eligibility (e.g., special deals), and reporting requirements.
HTS codes are hierarchical, ranging from broad 2-digit chapters to detailed 10-digit classifications.
