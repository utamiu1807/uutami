# Trump_Trade_EDA_Template
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of trade flows before/after the Trump administration  

Limitations:
1. There are 10 category for goods imported, which HTS 2, HTS 4, HTS 6, HTS 8, and HTS 10. For this analysis, I only using data for HTS 2 and HTS 4.
2. For 2025, There is only available data until August 2025.

## 📘 Executive Summary

- **2024:** Represented a stable, pre-tariff environment dominated by China, Mexico, and Canada.  
- **2025:** Marked by the introduction of reciprocal tariffs and selective trade deals that shifted import patterns.

The comparison between 2024 and 2025 CIF import values highlights how trade policies reshaped U.S. import dynamics. In 2024, import volumes reflected a stable, pre-tariff environment dominated by major partners such as China, Mexico, and Canada. By 2025, as reciprocal tariffs and selective trade deals took effect, the composition of top-importing countries began to shift: nations granted trade deals or exempt from tariffs generally maintained or increased their export values, while those hit by tariffs experienced noticeable declines.

The dual-panel visualization makes this contrast explicit — showing which partners benefited, which were insulated, and which faced contraction — providing a clear, data-driven view of the early economic impact of the Trump administration’s reciprocal-tariff policy.
The comparison between **2024 and 2025 CIF import values** highlights how trade policies reshaped U.S. import dynamics.


** Key Findings**
Policy reshaped trade patterns: Reciprocal tariffs in 2025 redistributed U.S. import sources.
Deal and Not-Hit countries expanded: Mexico, Canada, and parts of Southeast Asia maintained growth.
Only two of the Top 20 countries — Switzerland and Singapore — were not hit by tariffs, explaining Switzerland’s rise in 2025 data (through August).
Tariffed countries contracted: China and Germany declined notably vs 2024.
Regional diversification: Non-EU Asian exporters gained share as supply chains realigned.
Policy signals overrode volume: Tariff status correlated more with import change than trade size.

Nations with trade deals or tariff exemptions maintained or increased export values, while countries hit by tariffs (notably China and Germany) experienced visible declines. Regional diversification and policy-driven trade behavior emerged.

## 🧭 Methodology

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Data Collection** | CIF import datasets (2023–2025), Newsweek’s “Reciprocal Tariff” list, and product-level classifications. |
| **Cleaning** | Removed null rows, standardized columns, converted data types, dropped totals, and handled missing values. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Computed `% Change` between 2024–2025, created `deal_with_trump` variable, grouped by `Year`, `Country`, and `Description`. |
| **Classification** | Categorized products into sectors (e.g., *Machinery & Electronics*, *Textiles & Apparel*). |
| **Visualization** | Built comparative charts (2024 vs 2025), stacked bars, and regression coefficient plots using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. |
| **Statistical Analysis** | Performed correlation, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling. |

## 📈 Regression Analysis

Regression models were used to measure how trade policy and product type affected the **percent change in CIF import values** between 2024 and 2025.

**Dependent Variable:**  
`Percent Change in CIF Import Value (2024 → 2025)`

**Independent Variables:**
- `Program_Special` — indicator for special trade programs  
- `Deal_with_Trump` — 1 = tariff exemption / 0 = tariffed  
- `HS_Chapter` — product classification

### 📊 Regression Summary

| Variable | Coefficient (β) | Std. Error | t-value | p-value | 95% CI [Lower, Upper] |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| Intercept | 0.052 | 0.018 | 2.88 | 0.005 | [0.017, 0.087] |
| Program_Special | +0.041 | 0.012 | 3.42 | 0.001 | [0.017, 0.065] |
| Deal_with_Trump | -0.039 | 0.014 | -2.79 | 0.006 | [-0.066, -0.011] |
| HS_Chapter | 0.009 | 0.003 | 3.00 | 0.003 | [0.003, 0.015] |
| **R²** | **0.62** | | | | |

**Interpretation:**
- Special trade programs and deals correlate positively with import growth.  
- Tariffed products (negative coefficient) show significant contraction.  
- Policy-related variables explain ~62% of variance in CIF percent change.

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Trade policies reshaped U.S. import structure** in less than one fiscal year.  
- **Deal and Not-Hit countries** (e.g., Mexico, Canada, Singapore) maintained or grew import share.  
- **Tariffed countries** (e.g., China, Germany) experienced contraction.  
- **Switzerland** saw an early upward trend — one of two top-20 countries unaffected by tariffs.  
- **Policy expectations** significantly affected trade flows, even beyond actual tariff rates.  
- Early signs of **supply-chain diversification** away from high-tariff regions.
